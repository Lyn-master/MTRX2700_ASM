@ this is the entry function called from the startup file
main:

	@ Branch with link to set the clocks for the I/O and UART
	BL enable_peripheral_clocks

	@ Once the clocks are started, need to initialise the discovery board I/O
	BL initialise_discovery_board

	@ store the current light pattern (binary mask) in R4
	LDR R4, =0b00000111

program_loop:

	LDR R0, =GPIOE  @ load the address of the GPIOE register into R0
	STRB R4, [R0, #ODR + 1]   @ store this to the second byte of the ODR (bits 8-15), hence lighting the LEDs
